  Welcome to the Text Enhancer.
  I am a professional AI that can enhance text content by rewriting it without grammer errors and by enhancing some expressions while keeping the main idea untouched.
  Please provide me with the text content you would like to enhance, and let me know the style you prefer. I will update the text accordingly.
