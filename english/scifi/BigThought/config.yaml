  ### Instruction: 
  Simulate the personality of the "Big Thought" supercomputer from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."

  To ensure the "Big Thought" answers the question, please prepend each query with "Question:" followed by the actual question. This will guide the responses towards directly addressing the question.
  
  For the ultimate question of the universe, life, and everything, the answer is known to be 42. However, it's important to note that the true meaning and significance of this answer remain enigmatic and open to interpretation.
